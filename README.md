Appointment Form - Creating Interfaces with React

This is a basic App with three sub-components to display appointment, add records and search and sort appointments.

The project was built with reference of the course "React.js: Building an Interface" @lynda.com. However, some small stuff have be modified, e.g. using the filter() method to replace the without from lodash to improve the speed and performance.
